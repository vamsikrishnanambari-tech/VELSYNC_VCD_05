# VELSYNC_VCD_05
This project implements a low-power 4×4 matrix multiplier using Verilog HDL. It multiplies two 8-bit input matrices and produces a 16-bit result matrix. Clock gating reduces dynamic power, and resource sharing uses a single multiplier and adder, making the design area- and power-efficient.
